# Digital Public Safety AI

An AI-powered public safety platform that leverages Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to detect counterfeit Indian currency and identify scam or phishing messages through a unified web application.

The platform combines computer vision and transformer-based language models with a modern web interface to provide fast, accurate, and explainable predictions while maintaining a searchable history of all analyses.

## Overview

Digital fraud continues to evolve in multiple forms, including counterfeit currency circulation and online phishing or scam campaigns. Traditional verification methods are often manual, time-consuming, and inaccessible to the general public.

Digital Public Safety AI addresses these challenges by integrating two independent AI systems into a single platform:

- Counterfeit Currency Detection using Computer Vision
- Scam & Phishing Text Detection using Natural Language Processing

Each prediction is stored in a centralized database, allowing users to review previous analyses, inspect detailed reports, and monitor overall statistics through an interactive dashboard.
